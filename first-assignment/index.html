		<p style="font-size: 18px">QUEENS, NY – The Trump Administration's new public charge rule was scheduled to take effect on Tuesday, October 15th. The proposed ruling would make it easier for the federal government to deny permanent status for immigrants who rely on public benefit programs like Medicaid, public housing benefits, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
	<br><br>
		 Eight lawsuits filed across the country, including two in New York City, have been working to halt the change. Today, Judge George B. Daniels of New York "issued a temporary injunction" against the Trump administration, which will prevent the rule from taking effect on the 15th, according to NPR.
	<br><br>
		In Corona, 47% of residents are born outside the United States. A chilling effect generated by fear, confusion, and misinformation has gripped the community since last year, when the proposal was first announced. Many legal residents without a permanent residency status had prematurely stopped using public benefit programs like SNAP to buy food, while others were preparing to do so. The new court ruling offers a bit of relief for the community in Corona, who have endured what Mayor Bill de Blasio has called "yet another attempt by the Trump administration to instill fear and concern among working immigrant families".
<br><br>
		Every Friday from June through November at the GrowNYC Greenmarket in Corona Plaza, farmers from upstate New York provide fresh fruit and vegetables for local families. The Corona Green Market has the city's 9th highest rate of SNAP sales out of 49 markets across New York City. While having to choose between food on the table and a pathway to residency would be an impossible choice for many, the community has shown strength and resiliance.

While most of the produce at the Corona Greenmarket is not deemed organic, it is often a healthier and fresher option than that of grocery stores in the area.</p>

Farmers estimate between 60-80% of their sales at this location come from SNAP sales, contending that if customers who rely on SNAP stopped buying produce at the market, the farms would suffer as a result. </p>

			<p class="caption" style="font-size: 18px">Before today’s ruling, many shoppers were either preparing to stop using SNAP or searching for other ways to make ends meet. While the court has halted the Public Charge Rule for now, an atmosphere of fear and confusion continues to hang over the community. But the immigrant community in Corona has a strong support system. Residents, alongside community organizations and local politicians, continue to rise above the White House’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. </p>
