			<p>According to a 2019 report by the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, the community district of Corona and Elmhurst had New York City’s highest rate of severe crowding in 2017 at 11.7%. Severe crowding, caused in large part by rising rent prices and lack of affordable housing, is defined as more than 1.5 people per room. Illegal Conversions crop up as an impermanent solution to the crisis, resulting in cramped and often hazardous living conditions.</p>

			<p>“Illegal conversions are one of our higher priorities,” says Andrew Rudanski, a spokesperson from the Department of Buildings. “We have a quality of life unit that specifically handles these complaints.”</p>

			<p>Complaints of illegal conversion residencies are submitted anonymously through 311. The Department of Buildings then addresses the service requests within an average of 10 days, while complaints deemed an “immediate hazard” are addressed within 24 hours.</p>
