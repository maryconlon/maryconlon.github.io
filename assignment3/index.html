				<h2>2017 surveillance data of blood lead levels in children under 6 years old shows levels greater than 5 µg/dL and 10 µg/dL.</h2>

							In the United States, at least four million households have
							children living in them who are being exposed to high levels of lead, with approximately half a million of
							those children aged 1–5 years with blood lead levels above five micrograms per deciliter, the reference
							level at which CDC recommends initiating public health action. Source: CDC /

				<div class="body"><p>The Center for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) monitors blood lead levels for children under 6 years old by state, county and year. For New York State, they measured these levels for approximately ¼ of each county’s population. According to the data, Fulton County appears to have the highest rate of children with dangerous blood lead levels.</p></div>

					<p>Angela Stuart Palmer, Assistant Director of the Fulton County Public Health Department, attributes her county’s high exposure to an abundance of old homes and structures. She cites dust from paint and chipping falling into the ground as a major concern for children. Lead paint was what was predominantly available prior to 1978, so any house built before then is considered a high risk.</p>
					<p>“School districts have done lead testing, as required by the state to do,” says Palmer. “But I have not heard that our school district has abnormally high levels of lead.”</p>
					<p>Counties like Fulton are trying to get the word out about lead prevention. Rochester, in Monroe County, has been plagued in the past with high lead blood levels. But they are now a leading example in educating the public about lead testing, especially for 1 and 2-year-old children. </p>
					<p>As of October of this year, the CDC now uses a statewide blood lead reference value of 5 ug/dl as opposed to 10 ug/dl in diagnosing dangerous lead exposure. </p>
